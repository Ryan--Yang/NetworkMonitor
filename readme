NetworkMonitor
      to my teacher and mentor, Ms. Iulia Mogoran


NetworkMonitor is a free, open-source and cross-platform network packet analyzer that can be used for network troubleshooting, analysis and education. NetworkMonitor also provides a sleek UI, Qt style.


This application was a dissertation project, submitted in support of my candidature for master's degree.

  Qt SDK	(http://qt.nokia.com/downloads)
  pcap API	(Unix-like systems implement pcap in the libpcap library, while Windows uses a port of libpcap known as WinPcap)
